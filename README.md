# Clone Voter List of Nepal

Clones the voter list of all registered Nepali voters from the official election commision website. This codebase is to prove that the website is **poorly** made with regards to security and privacy of the voters' data.

The project should hopefully force the Government of Nepal to secure all the data of the voters, make it private and give it the utmost priority it truly deserves.
